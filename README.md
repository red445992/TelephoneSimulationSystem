### Class Hierarchy

- **`Tsm`**: Main class that launches the application
- **`welcome`**: Welcome screen with simulation mode selection
- **`MainTSM`**: Implements lost call simulation with visual display
- **`Delay`**: Handles delay call simulation scenarios

## üìä Simulation Types

### Lost Call Simulation (Erlang-B)

- Models telephone systems where blocked calls are lost
- Simulates up to 3 simultaneous connections
- Tracks call statistics: processed, completed, blocked, busy
- Visual representation of active connections

### Delay Call Simulation (Erlang-C)

- Models systems where calls wait in queue when all lines are busy
- Handles call delays and queue management
- Provides delay statistics and performance metrics

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Could not find or load main class" Error**

```bash
# Solution: Ensure proper package structure
mkdir -p com/mycompany/tsm
move *.class com/mycompany/tsm/
java -cp . com.mycompany.tsm.Tsm
```

**GUI Not Displaying**

- Ensure Java GUI libraries are available
- Check display settings and resolution
- Verify Java version compatibility

**Paint Method Not Working**

- Ensure graphics are drawn in visible area
- Check color constants (use `Color.GREEN` not `Color.green`)
- Verify component layering and overlap

### Performance Tips

- Use reasonable call lengths to avoid system overload
- Monitor system resources during long simulations
- Restart application if GUI becomes unresponsive

## üìà Statistics Explained

- **Processed**: Total number of calls that entered the system
- **Completed**: Successfully connected and completed calls
- **Blocked**: Calls rejected due to no available links
- **Busy**: Calls rejected due to busy lines
- **Clock**: Current simulation time
- **In Use**: Number of currently active connections
